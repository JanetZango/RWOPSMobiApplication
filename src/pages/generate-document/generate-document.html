  <h3>Section D: Declaration</h3>
  <p class="declarationParagraph">I <b>{{firstname}} {{surname}}</b> hereby confirm that the information
    supplied in this
    application
    form is correct and undertake to assist my
    department in meeting its service delivery demands, including overtime commitments (if applicable), which
    includes being on call/standby (when applicable) as scheduled. I acknowledge that my first commitment is to
    meet the operational objectives of my department.
    I confirm that my performance of other remunerative work will in no way interfere with my commitments to my
    department.
    I confirm that my performance of other remunerative work will not take place during the hours I am required
    for duties as agreed in my employment contract.
    I confirm that I will not use any state resources for the purpose of performing other remunerative work.
    I accept that I shall not conduct business with any organ of the state, either in person or as part of an
    entity (including non-profit organisations).
    I accept that permission to perform other remunerative work is only granted for the time agreed upon (and
    reflected on the certificate of approval), and that it only applies to the services/types of remunerative
    work
    as indicated in this application form.
    I accept that, should I wish to continue with such remunerative work, I must submit a new application at
    least
    30 days before expiry.
    I accept that non-compliance with any of the conditions, monitoring or control measures pertaining to other
    remunerative work may lead to disciplinary action and that the sanction imposed includes forfeiture of
    remuneration and/or benefits gained.
    I accept that the normal policies and measures governing discipline also apply in terms of non-compliance
    with
    the other remunerative work policy and measures.
    I agree to abide by any control measures applicable to the other remunerative work system, including that it
    may be required of me to sign in and out each time I enter or exit the institution where I perform my basic
    or
    overtime duties.
    I agree to attach the certificate of approval when disclosing my financial interests, if applicable.
    I acknowledge that the Executive Authority or delegated authority can, at any time, terminate my
    authorisation
    to perform other remunerative work, based on a change in operational requirements and/or poor performance on
    my part.</p>
